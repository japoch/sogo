[SOGo](http://www.sogo.nu) is fully supported and trusted groupware server with a focus on scalability and open standards. SOGo is released under the GNU GPL/LGPL v2 and above. 

This Dockerfile packages SOGo compiled from the sources from [Alinto/SOGo](https://github.com/Alinto/sogo) together with [Alinto/SOPE](https://github.com/Alinto/sope), [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) and [memcached](https://memcached.org/).

Prepared Docker images for Linux/AMD64, Linux/ARM/V7 and Linux/ARM/V8 are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/japoch/sogo/pkgs/container/sogo). Tested on [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/), [Banana Pi](https://www.banana-pi.org/) and [Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL).

## Setup

Run the Docker container with

    docker run --rm --name sogo ghcr.io/japoch/sogo:main

We provide a full functional setup with docker compose.

    docker compose up -d

Additional you run the compose file as an systemd service.

    cp ./artifacts/sogo-docker.service /etc/systemd/system
    systemctl start sogo-docker.service && systemctl enable sogo-docker.service

    # and check logs with
    docker compose logs -f
    # and with
    journalctl -u sogo-docker.service -f

### Generate self-signed SSL key for Dovecot

openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -sha512 -x509 -days 365 -nodes -keyout dovecot-root/certs/dovecot_cert/smtp.key -out dovecot-root/certs/dovecot_cert/smtp-key.pem

### Database

A separate database is required, for example a MariaDB container as provided by the Docker image [linuxserver/mariadb](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/mariadb), but also any other database management system SOGo supports can be used. Follow the _Database Configuration_ chapter of the SOGo documentation on these steps, and modify the `sogo.conf` file accordingly.

### memcached

As most users will not want to separate memcached, there is a built-in daemon.

### Sending Mail

For further details in MTA configuration including SMTP auth, refer to SOGo's documentation.

### NGINX and HTTPs

As already given above, the default NGINX configuration is already available under `artifacts/nginx.conf` and  `nginx-conf/sites-enabled/sogo-nginx.conf`. The container exposes HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and 20000, the default port the SOGo daemon listens on. You can directly include the certificates within the container.

### Cron-Jobs: Backup, Session Timeout, Sieve

SOGo heavily relies on cron jobs for different purposes. The image provides SOGo's original cron file as `artifacts/sogo.cron`. The backup script is available and made executable at the location `/usr/local/share/doc/sogo/sogo-backup.sh`, so backup is fully functional after uncommenting the respective cron job and after rebuild the image.

### Further Configuration

Remember to start a reasonable number of worker processes matching to your needs (8 will not be enough for medium and larger instances):

    WOWorkersCount = 8;

All other configuration options have no special considerations.

## Build

### Requirements

Docker >19.03.0 Beta 3 with BuildX plugin with the full support of the features provided by [Moby BuildKit builder toolkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit).

You need an personal access token (classic) to publish, install, and delete private, internal, and public packages.
Please read [Authenticating to the Container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry).

### Build and Push

Build the image with the following command lines.

    source .env
    docker login ghcr.io
    docker buildx create --name testbuilder --use
    docker buildx build --platform ${BUILD_PLATFORMS} -t ghcr.io/japoch/sogo:latest -t ghcr.io/japoch/sogo:${VERSION} --push .

## Usage

### Usermanagement

Preparation: Set the needed environment variables like this.
```bash
sogo_user='user.name'
sogo_pass='password'
sogo_name='User Name'
sogo_fqhn='localhost'
```

View the user table with `docker compose exec db mysql -u sogo -ppassword -D sogo -e "SELECT * FROM sogo_view;"`

Insert a new user into SOGo with `docker compose exec db mysql -u sogo -ppassword -D sogo -e "INSERT INTO sogo_view VALUES('$sogo_user', '$sogo_user', MD5('$sogo_pass'), '$sogo_name', '$sogo_user@$sogo_fqhn');"`

Update password with `docker compose exec db mysql -u sogo -ppassword -D sogo -e "UPDATE sogo_view SET c_password=MD5('$sogo_pass') WHERE c_uid='$sogo_user';"`

Remove an user from SOGo with `docker compose exec db mysql -u sogo -ppassword -D sogo -e "DELETE FROM sogo_view WHERE c_uid='$sogo_user'"`

Upgrade database after upgrade client with `docker compose exec db mariadb-upgrade -u root -ppassword`

### Backup / Restore

Preparation: Start an Bash shell from inside SOGo's Docker container with `docker compose exec sogo bash`.

Create backup of all or of one single user with `sogo-tool backup /mnt/backup [ALL | username]`.

List content of backup with `sogo-tool restore -l /mnt/backup username`.

Restore parameters (signature, filters ....) with `sogo-tool restore -p /mnt/backup username`.

Restore the folders (calenders and contacts) of one user with `sogo-tool restore -f ALL /mnt/backup username`.

or use SOGos browser import/export function.

## Known Bugs

### Data too long for column 'c_value'

Error message

    [ERROR] <0x0x55b6f2205810[GCSSessionsFolder]> -[GCSSessionsFolder writeRecordForEntryWithID:value:creationDate:lastSeenDate:]: cannot write record: <MySQL4Exception: 0x55b6f23655f0> NAME:ExecutionFailed REASON:Data too long for column 'c_value' at row 1

Bug tracking

    https://bugs.sogo.nu//view.php?id=5491
    The cookie is now much bigger than before. Just bellow 4096 bytes, to accommodate longer passwords.

Solution

```sql
-- Enlarging the column c_value from 255 to 4096.
alter table sogo_sessions_folder modify c_value varchar(4096) not null;
```
